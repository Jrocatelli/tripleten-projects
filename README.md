# Data Science Projects Repository

## Overview
Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that I developed during the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp. Each one of them represents the conclusion of a sprint on a specific study topic. These projects make use of machine learning concepts, Python, and popular libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn. The code for each project is organized in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Some projects

### 1. [Forecasting the Price of a Car](https://github.com/Jrocatelli/tripleten-projects/tree/main/car_price)
This project marks the conclusion of the 'Numerical Analysis' sprint. The primary objective is to build a robust model capable of predicting a car's price based on historical sales data. The project explores and compares the quality and efficiency of various models, with a focus on incorporating gradient boosting for enhanced performance.

Technologies Used: `Pandas` `NumPy` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn` `Scikit-learn` `CatBoost` `LightGBM` `XGBoost` 

### 2. [Predicting Clients Leaving BetaBank](https://github.com/Jrocatelli/tripleten-projects/tree/main/bank_churn)
This project concludes the 'Supervised Learning' sprint. The goal is to develop a classification model predicting clients who are likely to leave BetaBank. The model utilizes information about both existing and former clients, including features such as credit score, gender, and the number of products held with the bank. The model is required to achieve an F1 score higher than 59% on the test dataset.

Technologies Used: `Pandas` `Scikit-learn` `Logistic Regression` `Decision Tree` `Random Forest`

### 3. [Analyzing the Success of Video Game Titles](https://github.com/Jrocatelli/tripleten-projects/tree/main/videogame_store)
This project marks the conclusion of the 'Exploratory Data Analysis' sprint. The objective is to analyze sales data of video game titles from a multinational store. The objective is to identify patterns in games that generate significant revenues in each region. The insights gained from this analysis can be utilized by the marketing team to plan effective advertising strategies.

Technologies Used: `Pandas` `Seaborn` `Matplotlib` `Plotly Express`

This project is the final part of the 'Numerical analysis' sprint at the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp. The objective is to develop a model capable of predicting a car's price based on historical sales data. For this project, in particular, we aim to delve into and compare the quality and efficiency of different models, incorporating gradient boosting to achieve superior results more swiftly.
